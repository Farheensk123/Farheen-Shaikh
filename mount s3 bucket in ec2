following is the process to mount s3 bucket into ec2 using ubantu:-

first we need to create 1 instance in that select ubuntu as OS image < Keep everything as default < launch instance.
instance should be in running mode.
then,
 install awscli and s3fs utlity for that 
open ubuntu pannel, write this codde

sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install awscli -y
sudo apt-get install s3fs -y

After that Create an IAM user for s3fs
Give a unique name and provide programmatic access 
attach a s3 full permission < create policy.
Once the policy is created, go back to the IAM tab and hit refresh so that newly created policy is included in the list.

go to ubuntu, write down below code,
mkdir /home/ubuntu/bucket; 
cd $HOME/bucket ;
touch test1.txt test2.txt test3.txt

Next step is to create an S3 bucket.
Go to S3 service and create a new bucket. 
Once the bucket is created, go to the ssh session and configure our AWS using below command.
aws configure
aws s3 sync path_on_filesystem s3://bucketname
$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:$AWS_SECRET_KEY_ID
echo "AKIAQSCIQUH6XXYQMGDA:T5qM7rZmSaU3p/Y0xmuZyWv1/KUnT0Oc58sdCJ3t" > ${HOME}/.passwd-s3fs; -------> (access key and secret key)
chmod 600 ${HOME}/.passwd-s3fs
Once it is mounted successfully, you can verify by running the command.
mount|grep s3fs
now you can check s3 bucket and file...
